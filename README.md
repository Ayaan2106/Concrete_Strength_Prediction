# Concrete Strength Prediction

Predicting compressive strength of concrete using XGBoost, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbours.

## What’s included
- `Recognition of Concrete Code - Final.ipynb` — Full analysis & results (notebook).
- `Concrete_Data.csv` — Dataset (original encoding required: `latin1`).
- Plots are generated in the notebook; key results: XGBoost R² ≈ 0.93, MAE ≈ 2.72 are generated in a table.
