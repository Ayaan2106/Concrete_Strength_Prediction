Concrete Strength Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the compressive strength of concrete in MPa using input features like cement, water, and age. The model is trained with XGBoost, k-nearest neighbour, and random forest. The setup includes tools for visualisation and analysis.

Features
-Predict concrete compressive strength using a pre-trained model.
-Visualize data and predictions with matplotlib and seaborn.
-Display results in tabular format using tabulate.
-Easy setup with a clean requirements.txt for reproducibility.

Requirements
The project requires Python 3.10+ and the following packages (already included in requirements.txt):
